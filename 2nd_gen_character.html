			A member of the Council and the Warden of "Time," the third concept birthed by the Gods and the one most intrinsically linked with mankind.<br><br>

None may escape the sands of time and, indeed, most men do not even wish to be freed from her captivity. She picked up the blades almost as a reflex action of sorts, and seems to be enjoying it. Her quiet, aloof personality has never changed over the ages, but she has developed a little bit of haughtiness and sadistic tendencies along the way...
			
			<br><br><hr>
			Personality<br>
			
			Ouro Kronii is very confident, self-centered, and completely unafraid to praise herself. However, she also describes herself as someone who is generally not a happy person, to the point of listing "existential dread" as a hobby. Kronii can be playful at times, especially with her Kronies, and the combination of her deadpan humor and dry delivery of jokes contrasts many of the other members who are either more outgoing or gentler with their words. Her voice is noted to be powerful and well-controlled, and tends to give off an "older sister" vibe.<br><br>

Kronii is generally very self-conscious, meaning she actively looks out for her own mistakes - "that's on me" and "that was my bad" are phrases that she says often when playing. She vocalizes rather explosively whenever she takes damage or is killed in video games. While she has a deep voice comparable to Mori Calliope's, she also has a notably wide vocal-range; she once produced a high-pitched voice by a viewer's request.<br><br>

Ceres Fauna described Kronii as cool, funny, good at memes, and having a voice that she wants to read her to sleep every night. She described that Kronii has a substantial capacity for "gap moe," a cute side that comes out when she is flustered, in contrast to her normally cool nature. Despite her lore describing her as a haughty sadist, she has shown to be very accommodating to both her chat and her genmates. Her narcissism can creep in at times, to the point that her advice to viewers is often jokingly to "just be better," though the dynamic with her chat is such that they have done just the same to her when she needs help in video games.</b></font></td></tr>

A member of the Council and the Guardian of "Civilization," a concept crafted by mankind.
<br><br>
As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts‚Äîthe mark that humans have left on the world‚Äîshe is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.
<br><br>
She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.
<br><br>
For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels. That is what gave her the idea of making her own friend out of a material that was indispensable to the development of human civilization: paper.

			A member of the Council and the very concept of Chaos, birthed by the world, itself.

The Gods appointed her Chairperson of the Council, but she mostly takes a hands-off approach as she has yet to accept the decision, much like her fellow members. That said, all of them have no intention of contending; instead to obey.

Her mouse-like appearance has deceived many a fool who fails to realize that mice are the harbingers of chaos.

Ceres Fauna even described her as a natural born leader, and Baelz eventually embraced the role of "Leader of -Council-."
				<br><br>
