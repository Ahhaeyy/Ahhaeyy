			The Grim Reaper's first apprentice. Because the world's medical system advanced so dramatically, Calliope became a VTuber to collect souls. It seems that the lost souls vaporized by the wholesome relationships of VTubers flow through her as well. In the end, she's a gentle-hearted girl whose sweet voice contradicts the morbid things she tends to say, as well as her hardcore vocals.
			
			
			<br><br><hr>
			Personality<br>
			
Calliope is equally excited by both rapping and "reaping." Her favorite weapons include her scythe (nicknamed "Ricky") and the flail, a medieval weapon made from a spiked metal ball on a chain.

Calliope is noted for having one of the most lowest pitched voice in hololive, even more so than likes of Nekomata Okayu, Tokoyami Towa and A-chan. Although fluent in English, Calliope often fails to understand current modes of speech, such as the use of contractions or modern slang. She is easily flustered by romance, leading some to call her the "tsundereaper."

When not on camera, however, she is described as air-headed and hopelessly forgetful. Kiara has mentioned that she frequently misplaces things despite leaving them in an obvious place, like leaving her cellphone in her jacket. She also works exceptionally hard, perhaps too much so.

			<br><br>
			She works extremely hard since she will be reborn from ashes anyway.
			
			
			<br><br>
				<hr>
			Personality<br>
Kiara is enthusiastic and friendly, and is open with her feelings. She cares strongly for her friends and family, and misses them a great deal while she is abroad. Although energetic and sometimes chaotic in nature, and eager to collab with other members, she is secretly quite shy. She is sometimes bird-brained, being forgetful or having a short attention span. She prefers video games with fixed goals, such as RPGs, rather than open-world games like Minecraft.

On a graph ranking members in purity and intelligence, Kiara was rated "bottom left"‚Äîmaximum lewd and foolish, much to her bemusement. However, she often surprises viewers with moments of gentleness, compassion, and insightful wisdom.

Watson Amelia, in her debut stream, described Kiara as having a "positive attitude and lovely voice." Mori Calliope described her as a hard worker and an incredible singer with a great personality, and praised her fluency with Japanese.

Kiara has a particular fondness for Mori Calliope. Kiara, a phoenix who has been continuously reborn, always meets Calliope each time she dies. However, it is not within Calliope's power to keep a phoenix in the Underworld.

    <tr><td><font face="Kristen ITC">Amelia heard strange rumors surrounding Hololive online: talking foxes, magical squirrels, superhuman dogs, and more. Soon after beginning her investigation on Hololive, and just out of interest, she decided to become an idol herself! She loves to pass her time training her reflexes with FPS games, and challenging herself with puzzle games.
		It's elementary, right?
		
		<br><br><hr>
			Personality<br>
		Amelia is a rather eccentric girl who is often seen mingling or teasing her fellow holoMyth members. She is usually kind, supportive, and sweet as shown when she frequently watches her fellow members' streams and often willingly helps Gura in Minecraft. However Amelia also likes to joke around with the other members and sometimes even doing lewd remarks such as naming one of her mines in Minecraft "Gura's Backdoor."

She also harbors another side of her personality that is often referred by her fans as "Gremlin Mode". She can be greedy, prideful, and unsportsmanlike in competitive online games such as, Apex Legends, and Valorant. For these reasons, fans often refer to her as a "True Gamer." Amelia has a special voice that she uses when she is in Gremlin Mode, which sounds like a cross between a high-pitched wheeze, reptilian screech, and the final breath of a dying squeaky toy. She is not above trolling and calling out her chat if the opportunity arises, such as when she trolled her viewers in one of her Minecraft streams by adjusting her shader's brightness very darkly and innocently claiming that she fixed the shaders for them. Despite these circumstances, she tries her best to moderate her gremlin-like behavior, to varying degrees of success.

Possibly her best-known joke is "ground pounding your mom," which she said once during a Super Mario Odyssey playthrough and has since become almost synonymous with her character. She frequently makes similar lewd remarks seemingly out of nowhere. It might seem that Amelia has no filter, but that isn't entirely accurate. She does have a filter, but most of the outrageous things that are caught in her filter end up being said out loud regardless.

Overall, her balanced chemistry of sweetness and saltiness makes her very lovable as noted by her fans.

			A descendant of the Lost City of Atlantis, who swam to Earth while saying, "It's so boring down there LOLOLOL!" Gura bought her clothes (and her shark hat) in the human world and she really loves them. In her spare time, she enjoys talking to marine life.
			
			<br><br><hr>
			Personality<br>
			
			Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers with foolish antics. She has no sense of direction, often misspells and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering her own age, and consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to affectionately call her a "dum shark". Memorably, one viewer declared that "Gura has a heart of gold and a head of bone."

She can also be lazy at times. She often forgets about perishable items until they start to rot, and eats baby food "because you don't have to cook it... [or] chew on it."

However, despite her poor math and spelling skills, Gura is quick-witted, clever, and has vast knowledge of Shark Facts. When questioned on why she was not "boing boing," she excused it by claiming that she was "hydrodynamic." Her skill with fast-paced rhythm games is exceptional, and she is highly ambitious. She also occasionally makes lewd jokes, and is familiar with modern meme culture, which she references often.

			One day, Ina'nis picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her. However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.

After gaining power, she started hearing Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to deliver random sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.

			
			<br><br><hr>
			Personality<br>
			
Despite her Lovecraftian-themed appearance, Ina is gentle, peaceful and down-to-earth. She is considerate and kind; Takanashi Kiara relates that when she is down, Ina is always the first to message her. In complete contrast to the salty gremlin Amelia, Ina has near-infinite patience and is widely considered the most well-behaved member of her generation.

Ina is infamous for her use of puns and dry delivery of "dad jokes."
